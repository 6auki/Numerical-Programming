## 1. Ball Interceptor System
A comprehensive projectile interception simulation that combines computer vision, kinematics, and optimization to solve real-world targeting problems.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Design a system that can intercept a moving projectile by:
- Detecting and tracking a falling ball from video footage
- Predicting its future trajectory using kinematic equations
- Computing optimal launch parameters (velocity and angle) to intercept the target
- Accounting for realistic constraints like launch delays

#### 🔧 System Components
##### Interception Engine (ball_interceptor.py) - Core interception logic and animation
- Predicts target position at any future time using kinematic equations
- Performs grid search optimization over launch velocity and angle ranges
- Accounts for launch delays in the interception calculation
- Uses 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration for accurate trajectory simulation

##### Computer Vision Detection (detect-ball.py)
- Extracts ball position and velocity from video using OpenCV
- Uses HSV color space filtering and contour detection
- Implements linear regression to estimate initial velocity from early frames
- Converts pixel coordinates to real-world measurements

##### Video Generation (create_falling_ball_video.py)
- Generates synthetic video footage of a falling ball with customizable physics
- Configurable initial conditions, gravity, and visual parameters
- Creates test data for the detection system

##### Visualization System
- Real-time matplotlib animation showing both projectile and target trajectories
- Visual confirmation of successful interception
- Trajectory plotting and analysis tools

###### 🛠️ Key Features
- Motion Prediction: Calculates future position of targets using physics-based models
- Optimization: Grid search algorithm finds optimal launch parameters
- Delay Compensation: Handles realistic launch delays in timing calculations
- Real-time Visualization: Animated interception scenarios with matplotlib
- Modular Design: Separate components for detection, prediction, and visualization

##### Test Cases
You can see attached test cases, you can change the parameters accordingly to test cases -> choose test case -> log
You can see outputs of test cases directly in "outputs of test cases".
Test cases include exact velocity, high velocity, interception delay, long distance interception falling ball...,

## 2. Sturm-Liouville Eigenvalue Solver
Advanced numerical solver for Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems using the shooting method combined with adaptive integration and binary search optimization.
Key Techniques: Shooting method, RK45 integration, binary search, eigenfunction normalization

Components:
- Input; Sturm-Liouville problem
- Task: find first 8 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
- Approach: visualisation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions


### Problem Statement
Solve the singular Sturm-Liouville equation:
-1/2 * cos⁴(x) * u''(x) - 1/2 * cos³(x)cos(2x)/sin(x) * u'(x) + [m²cos²(x)/(2sin²(x)) - cos(x)/sin(x)] * u(x) = λu(x)

Subject to boundary conditions: u(0) = 0 and u(π/2) = 0
This type of equation appears in quantum mechanics, vibration analysis, and heat transfer problems with variable coefficients.

#### Mathematical Approach
**Shooting Method Implementation**
- Converts second-order boundary value problem to initial value problem
- Uses u(0) = 0, u'(0) = 1 as initial conditions
- Searches for eigenvalues λ where u(π/2) ≈ 0

##### Adaptive Integration
- Employs SciPy's solve_ivp with RK45 (Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg) method
- Automatically adjusts step size for optimal accuracy
- Handles singular points near domain boundaries

##### Binary Search Optimization
- Iteratively narrows eigenvalue search interval
- Convergence tolerance: 1e-6
- Robust bracketing strategy with automatic interval expansion

##### Key Features
- Singularity Handling: Careful treatment of singular points at x=0 and x=π/2
- Domain Shrinkage: Uses [0.0001, π/2-0.0001] to avoid numerical instabilities
- Eigenfunction Normalization: L² normalization using trapezoidal integration
- Progressive Search: Automatically finds multiple eigenvalues sequentially
- Comprehensive Visualization: Multi-panel plots showing all eigenfunctions

##### Numerical Methods Demonstrated
- Shooting Method: Boundary value problem reduction technique
- Adaptive Integration: RK45 with automatic step size control
- Binary Search: Root-finding for eigenvalue determination
- System Reduction: Second-order to first-order ODE conversion
- Numerical Integration: Trapezoidal rule for normalization
